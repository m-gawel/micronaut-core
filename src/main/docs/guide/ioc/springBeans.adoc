The link:{api}/io/micronaut/spring/beans/MicronautBeanProcessor.html[MicronautBeanProcessor]
class is a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` which will add Micronaut beans to a
Spring Application Context.  An instance of `MicronautBeanProcessor` should
be added to the Spring Application Context.  `MicronautBeanProcessor` requires
a constructor parameter which represents the stereotype annotation for
the Micronaut beans which should be added the Spring Application Context.  The
processor may be used in any Spring application.  As an example, a Grails 3
application could take advantage of `MicronautBeanProcessor` to add all of the
Micronaut HTTP Client beans to the Spring Application Context with something
like the folowing:

```groovy
// grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy
import io.micronaut.spring.beans.MicronautBeanProcessor
import io.micronaut.http.client.Client

beans = {
    httpClientBeanProcessor MicronautBeanProcessor, Client
}
```
