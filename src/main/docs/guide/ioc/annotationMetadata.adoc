The methods provided by Java's link:{jdkapi}/java/lang/reflect/AnnotatedElement.html[AnnotatedElement] API in general don't provide the ability to introspect annotations without loading the annotations themselves, nor do they provide any ability to introspect annotation stereotypes (Often called meta-annotations, an annotation stereotype is where an annotation is annotated with another annotation, essentially inheriting its behaviour).

To solve this problem many frameworks produce runtime metadata or perform expensive reflection to analyze the annotations of a class.

Micronaut instead produces this annotation metadata at compile time, avoiding expensive reflection and saving on memory.

The link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/BeanContext.html[BeanContext] API can be used to obtain a reference to a link:{api}/io/micronaut/inject/BeanDefinition.html[BeanDefinition] which implements the link:{api}/io/micronaut/core/annotation/AnnotationMetadata.html[AnnotationMetadata] interface.

For example the following code will obtain all bean definitions annotated with a particular stereotype:

.Lookup Bean Definitions by Stereotype
[source,java]
----
BeanContext beanContext = ... // obtain the bean context
Collection<BeanDefinition> definitions =
    beanContext.getBeanDefinitions(Qualifiers.byStereotype(Controller.class))

for(BeanDefinition definition : definitions) {
    Controller controllerAnn = definition.getAnnotation(Controller.class);
    // do something with the annotation
}
----

The above example will find all link:{api}/io/micronaut/inject/BeanDefinition.html[BeanDefinition] annotated with `@Controller` regardless whether `@Controller` is used directly or inherited via an annotation stereotype.

Like Spring, Micronaut also supports an link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/AliasFor.html[@AliasFor] annotation that allows an annotation member to represent the value of another annotation member.
