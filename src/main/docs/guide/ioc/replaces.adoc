One significant difference between Micronaut's Dependency Injection system and Spring is the way beans can be replaced.

With Spring beans have names and you can effectively override another bean just be creating a bean with the same name regardless of the type of the bean. Spring also has the notion of bean registration order, hence in Spring Boot you have `@AutoConfigureBefore` and `@AutoConfigureAfter` the control how beans override each other.

This strategy leads to difficult to debug problems in cases where:

* Bean loading order changes, leading to unexpected results
* A bean with the same name overrides another bean with a different type

To avoid these problems, the design of Micronaut DI has no concept of bean names or load order. Beans have a type and a api:context.Qualifier[]. You cannot override a bean of a completely different type with another.

However, one feature that the Spring way of doing things enables is that it allows overriding existing beans to customize behaviour.

To support this use case Micronaut DI has an explicit ann:context.annotation.Replaces[] annotation, which integrates nicely with support for <<conditionalBeans, Conditional Beans>> and clearly documents and expresses the purpose and intent.

Basically any existing bean can be replaced by another bean that declares ann:context.annotation.Replaces[].

For example, consider the following class:

.JdbcBookService.java
[source,java]
----
include::{testsjava}/replaces/JdbcBookService.java[tags=replaces, indent=0]
}
----

You can define a class in `src/test/java` that replaces this class just for your tests:

.Using @Replaces
[source,java]
----
include::{testsjava}/replaces/MockBookService.java[tags=class, indent=0]
----

<1> The `MockBookService` declares that it replaces `JdbcBookService`
<2> But only for for the `test` environment
