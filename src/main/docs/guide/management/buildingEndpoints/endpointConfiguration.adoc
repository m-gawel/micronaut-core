Endpoints with the `endpoints` prefix can be configured through their default endpoint id. If an endpoint exists with the id of `foo`, it can be configured through `endpoints.foo`. In addition, default values can be provided through the `all` prefix.

For example, consider the following endpoint.

[source,java]
.FooEndpoint.java
----
@Endpoint("foo")
class FooEndpoint {
    ...
}
----

By default the endpoint will be enabled. To disable the endpoint, set `endpoints.foo.enabled` to false. If `endpoints.foo.enabled` is not set at all and `endpoints.all.enabled` is set to false, the endpoint will be disabled.

The configuration values for the endpoint override the ones for `all`. If `endpoints.foo.enabled` is explicitly set to `true` and `endpoints.all.enabled` is explicitly set to `false`, the endpoint will be enabled.

For all endpoints, the following configuration values can be set.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
    <any endpoint id>:
        enabled: Boolean
        sensitive: Boolean
        id: String
----

If the endpoint `id` is set through configuration, the URL where the endpoint is accessible also changes to reflect the value. For example if the `foo` endpoint id was changed to `bar`, the foo endpoint would be executed through `http://localhost:<port>/bar`.

By deafult, the endpoints' base path is set to `/`. You can change it. If you set `endpoints.all.path=/admin` the foo endpoint would be executed through `http://localhost:<port>/admin/bar`.
