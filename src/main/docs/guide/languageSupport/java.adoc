For Java, Micronaut uses a Java api:annotation.processing.BeanDefinitionInjectProcessor[] annotation processor to process classes at compile time and produce api:inject.BeanDefinition[] classes.

The major advantage here is that you pay a slight cost at compile time, but at runtime Micronaut is largely reflection-free, fast and consumes very little memory.

== Using Micronaut with Java 9+

Micronaut is built with Java 8, however works fine with Java 9/10 and above as well. The classes that Micronaut generates sit along side existing classes within the same package, hence do not violate anything regarding the Java module system.

There are some considerations to take into account when using Java 9/10 with Micronaut.

=== The javax.annotation package

The `javax.annotation`, which includes `@PostConstruct`, `@PreDestroy` etc. is no longer part of the core JDK but instead a module. If you run under Java 9+ you will need to import the module or add the dependency to your classpath:

.Adding the `javax.annotation` dependency
[source,groovy]
----
compile 'javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api:1.3.2'
----

== IDE Considerations

You can use any IDE to develop Micronaut, if you depend on your configured build tool (Gradle or Maven) to build the application.

However, if you wish to run tests within the IDE that is currently only possible with http://jetbrains.com/idea[IntelliJ IDEA].

For IntelliJ IDEA if you plan to use the IntelliJ compiler then you should enable annotation processing under the "Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors" by ticking the "Enable annotation processing" checkbox:

As of this writing, Eclipse has https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=534501[incomplete support] for Java annotation processors, hence you will have to delegate to BuildShip or M2Eclipse for building and running tests.

== Retaining Parameter Names

By default with Java, the parameter name data for method parameters is not retained at compile time. This can be a problem for Micronaut if you do not define parameter names explicitly and depend on an external JAR that is already compiled.

Consider this interface:

.Client Interface
[source,java]
----
interface HelloOperations {
    @Get("/hello/{name}")
    String hello(String name);
}
----

At compile time the parameter name `name` is lost and becomes simply `arg0` when compiled against or read via reflection later. To avoid this problem you have two options. You can either declare the parameter name explicitly:

.Client Interface
[source,java]
----
interface HelloOperations {
    @Get("/hello/{name}")
    String hello(@Parameter("name") String name);
}
----

Or alternatively it is recommended that you compile all byte code with `-parameters` flag to `javac`. See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/member/methodparameterreflection.html[Obtaining Names of Method Parameters]. For example in `build.gradle`:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
compileJava.options.compilerArgs += '-parameters'
----
