If you do include the `http-server-netty` dependency then Micronaut's <<healthEndpoint, Health Endpoint>> can be used to expose the health status of the Kafka consumer application.

For example if Kafka is not available the `/health` endpoint will return:

[source,json]
----
{
    "status": "DOWN",
    "details": {
        ...
        "kafka": {
            "status": "DOWN",
            "details": {
                "error": "java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException: Timed out waiting for a node assignment."
            }
        }
    }
}
----

NOTE: The `/health` endpoint is secured by default. You may need to set `endpoints.health.sensitive` to `false` or add the <<security, Security>> module to your application.
