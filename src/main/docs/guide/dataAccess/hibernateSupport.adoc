==== Setting up a Hibernate/JPA EntityManager

Micronaut features built in support for configuring a http://hibernate.org[Hibernate] / JPA `EntityManager` that builds on the <<sqlSupport, SQL DataSource support>>.

Once you have <<sqlSupport, configured one or many DataSources>> to use Hibernate you need to add the `hibernate-jpa` dependency to your build configuration:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
compile "io.micronaut.configuration:hibernate-jpa"
----

And that is it. For each registered SQL `DataSource`, Micronaut will configure the following beans using api:configuration.hibernate.jpa.EntityManagerFactoryBean[]:

* link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/boot/registry/StandardServiceRegistry.html[StandardServiceRegistry] - The Hibernate `StandardServiceRegistry`
* link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/boot/MetadataSources.html[MetadataSources] - The Hibernate `MetadataSources`
* link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/boot/SessionFactoryBuilder.html[SessionFactoryBuilder] - The Hibernate `SessionFactoryBuilder`
* link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/SessionFactory.html[SessionFactory] - The Hibernate `SessionFactory` bean which also implements the JPA `EntityManagerFactory` interface.


==== Customizing Hibernate / JPA Configuration

There are several different ways you can customize and configure how the `SessionFactory` is built. The easiest way is via configuration in `application.yml`. The following configuration demonstrates an example:

.Configuring Hibernate Properties
[source,yaml]
----
datasources:
    default:
        name: 'mydb'
jpa:
    default:
        packages-to-scan:
            - 'foo.bar'
            - 'foo.baz'
        properties:
            hibernate:
                hbm2ddl:
                    auto: update
                show_sql: true
----

The above example configures the packages to be scanned and sets properties to be passed to Hibernate. As you can see these are done on a per `DataSource` basis. Refer to the api:configuration.hibernate.jpa.JpaConfiguration[] configuration class for the possible options.

If you need even further control over how the `SessionFactory` is built then you can register api:context.event.BeanCreatedEventListener[] beans that listen for the creation of the link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/boot/SessionFactoryBuilder.html[SessionFactoryBuilder], link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/boot/MetadataSources.html[MetadataSources] etc. and apply your custom configuration in the listener.

You may also optionally create beans of type link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/integrator/spi/Integrator.html[Integrator] and link:{hibernateapi}/org/hibernate/Interceptor.html[Interceptor] and these will be picked up and injected automatically.

==== Using Spring Transaction Management

Micronaut's Hibernate integration will also automatically provide a Spring `HibernateTransactionManager` bean so you can use Spring-based transaction management.

You should use Micronaut's ann:spring.tx.annotation.Transactional[] annotation to ensure low-overhead, compile-time transaction management is applied to your classes.

==== Understanding LazyInitializationException

Micronaut is built on Netty which is based on a non-blocking, event loop model. JDBC and Hibernate are blocking APIs and hence when they are used in a Micronaut application the work is shifted to a blocking I/O thread pool.

When using ann:spring.tx.annotation.Transactional[] the Hibernate `Session` will only be open for the duration of this method execution and then will automatically be closed. This ensures that the blocking operation is kept as short as possible.

There is no notion of OpenSessionInView (OSIV) in Micronaut and never will be, since it is https://vladmihalcea.com/the-open-session-in-view-anti-pattern/[sub-optimal and not recommended]. You should optimize the queries that you write to return all the necessary data Micronaut will need to encode your objects into JSON.

If you encounter a `LazyInitializationException` when returning a Hibernate entity from a method it is an indication that your query is suboptimal and you should perform a join.


==== Using GORM for Hibernate

For Groovy users and users familiar with Grails framework special support for http://gorm.grails.org[GORM for Hibernate] is available. To use GORM for Hibernate you should not include the Micronaut's built in <<sqlSupport, SQL Support>> or the `hibernate-jpa` dependency since GORM itself takes responsibility for creating the `DataSource`, `SessionFactory` etc.

Instead you should only define the `hibernate-gorm` dependency, a connection pool implementation and the necessary JDBC driver. For example:

.Configuring GORM for Hibernate
[source,groovy]
----
  compile "io.micronaut.configuration:hibernate-gorm"
  // Use Tomcat connection pool
  runtime 'org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-jdbc:8.0.44'
  // Use H2 database driver
  runtime  'com.h2database:h2:1.4.196'
----

After that you should use the same http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#configuration[configuration properties described in the GORM documentation]. For example:

.Configuring GORM for Hibernate
[source,yaml]
----
dataSource:
    pooled: true
    dbCreate: create-drop
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:devDb
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
    username: sa
    password:
hibernate:
    cache:
        queries: false
        use_second_level_cache: true
        use_query_cache: false
        region.factory_class: org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.EhCacheRegionFactory
----

The following should be noted regarding using GORM for Hibernate in Micronaut:

* Each class you wish to be a GORM entity should be annotated with the `grails.gorm.annotation.Entity` annotation.
* Each method that interacts with GORM should be annotated with GORM's `grails.gorm.transactions.Transactional` to ensure a session is present. You can also add the `@Transactional` annotation to the class.
* By default Micronaut will scan for entities relative to your `Application` class. If you wish to customize this specify additional packages via the api:context.ApplicationContextBuilder[] when starting your application.
