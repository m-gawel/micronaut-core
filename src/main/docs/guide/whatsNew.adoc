Micronaut {version} includes the following changes:

=== File Watch and Server Restart

A new <<automaticRestart,Automatic Restart>> feature is included that allows the server to restart if a change occurs to a file. This feature can be used both in production and at development time to achieve automatic application restarts when changing source code (when combined with a third party tool such as Gradle or Kubernetes in production).

=== API Versioning Support

API versioning is now supported. See the <<apiVersioning, API Versioning>> documentation for more information on how to use this feature.

=== Jackson `@JsonView` Support

Support for using `@JsonView` on controller methods has been added can be optionally enabled by setting `jackson.json-view.enabled` to `true` in `application.yml`.

=== Support for Spring Cloud Config Server

If you are already using https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-config[Spring Config Server] then Micronaut now features native integration for distributed configuration.

See the <<distributedConfigurationSpringCloud, Documentation on Distributed Configuration with Spring Cloud Config>> for more information.

=== Refactoring of File Responses

In an effort to make a more consistent and understandable API, some methods and classes related to sending file responses have been deprecated. api:http.server.types.files.SystemFile[] is the replacement for api:http.server.types.files.AttachedFile[] and the constructors of api:http.server.types.files.StreamedFile[] have been deprecated in favor of new constructors that better convey the intended functionality.

=== Support for Freemarker Views

Support for rendering <<freemarker,Freemaker Views>> has been added.

=== Constraint Bean Support

For those using the `hibernate-validator` configuration, constraints will now be attempted to be retrieved from the bean context. This means you can now use dependency injection in your custom constraints.

=== Support for JCache Caching

Support has been added for the JCache specification. If you define a `javax.cache.CacheManager` bean it will be used for caching. For example:

.Using JCache Caching
[source,java]
----
@Factory
class CacheFactory {

    @Singleton
    @Bean
    CacheManager cacheManager() {
        CacheManager cacheManager = Caching.getCachingProvider()
                                           .getCacheManager();
        cacheManager.createCache('my-cache', new MutableConfiguration());
        return cacheManager;
    }
}

----
