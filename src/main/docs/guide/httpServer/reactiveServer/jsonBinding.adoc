The examples so far have dealt with simply text based responses, but the most common data interchange format nowadays is JSON.

In fact, the defaults in the api:http.annotation.Controller[] annotation specify that the controllers in Micronaut consume and produce JSON by default.

In order to do so in a non-blocking manner Micronaut builds on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] Asynchronous JSON parsing API and Netty such that the reading of incoming JSON is done in a non-blocking manner.

== Binding using Reactive Frameworks

From a developer perspective however, you can generally just work with Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) and can optionally use a Reactive framework such as RxJava or Reactor. The following is an example of a controller that reads and saves an incoming POJO in a non-blocking way from JSON:

.Using RxJava 2 to Read the JSON
[source,java]
----
include::{testsuite}/server/json/PersonController.java[tags=class, indent=0]

include::{testsuite}/server/json/PersonController.java[tags=single, indent=4]
}
----

<1> The method receives a RxJava rx:Single[] which emits the POJO once the JSON has been read
<2> The `map` method is used to store the instance in `Map`
<3> An api:http.HttpResponse[] is returned

Using CURL from the command line you can POST JSON to the `/people` URI for the server to receive it:

.Using CURL to Post JSON
----
$ curl -X POST localhost:8080/people -d '{"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Flintstone","age":45}'
----

== Binding Using CompletableFuture

The same method as the previous example can also be written with the jdk:java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture[] API instead:

.Using CompletableFuture to Read the JSON
[source,java]
----
include::{testsuite}/server/json/PersonController.java[tags=future, indent=0]
----

The above example uses the `thenApply` method to achieve the same as the previous example.


== Binding using POJOs

Note however, that if your method does not do any blocking I/O then you can just as easily write:

.Binding JSON POJOs
[source,java]
----
include::{testsuite}/server/json/PersonController.java[tags=regular, indent=0]
----

Micronaut will still using non-blocking I/O to read the JSON and only execute your method once the data has been read.

In other words, as a rule reactive types should be used when you plan to do further downstream I/O operations in which case they can greatly simplify composing operations.


TIP: The output produced by Jackson can be customized in a variety of manners, from defining Jackson modules to using https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations/wiki/Jackson-Annotations[Jackson's annotations]
