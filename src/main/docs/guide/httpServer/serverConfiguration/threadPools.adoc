The HTTP server is built on http://netty.io[Netty] which is designed as a non-blocking I/O toolkit in an event loop model.

To configure the number of threads used by the Netty https://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/channel/EventLoop.html[EventLoop], you can use `application.yml`:

.Configuring Netty Event Loop Threads
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
    server:
        netty:
           worker:
              threads: 8 # number of netty worker threads
----

NOTE: The default value is the value of the system property `io.netty.eventLoopThreads` or if not specified the available processors x 2

When dealing with blocking operations, Micronaut will shift the blocking operations to an unbound, caching I/O thread pool by default. You can configure the I/O thread pool using the api:scheduling.executor.ExecutorConfiguration[] named `io`. For example:

.Configuring the Server I/O Thread Pool
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
    executors:
        io:
           type: fixed
           nThreads: 75
----

The above configuration will create a fixed thread pool with 75 threads.
