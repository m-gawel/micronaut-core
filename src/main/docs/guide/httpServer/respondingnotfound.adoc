Often, you want to respond 404 (Not Found) when you don't find an item in your persistence layer or in similar scenarios.

To simplify this scenario, a 404 is returned if your controller method returns null. See the following example:

[source,java]
----
include::{testshttpservernetty}/respondingnotfound/BooksController.java[tags=clazz]
include::{testshttpservernetty}/respondingnotfound/BooksController.java[tags=stock]
include::{testshttpservernetty}/respondingnotfound/BooksController.java[tags=bookInventoryByIsbn]
----

<1> Returning `null` triggers a 404 (Not Found) response.

You can do the same if you return reactive type such as `Maybe`. For example,
if you return `Maybe.empty()` a 404 is returned since an item is not emitted.
