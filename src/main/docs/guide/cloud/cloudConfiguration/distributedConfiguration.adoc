As you can see, Micronaut features a robust system for externalizing and adapting configuration to the environment inspired by similar approaches found in Grails and Spring Boot.

However, what if you want two Microservices to share configuration? Micronaut comes with built in APIs for doing distributed configuration.

The api:discovery.config.ConfigurationClient[] interface has a single method called `getPropertySources` that can be implemented to read and resolve configuration from distributed sources.

The `getPropertySources` returns a rs:Publisher[] that emits zero or many api:context.env.PropertySource[] instances.

The default implementation is api:discovery.config.DefaultCompositeConfigurationClient[] which merges all registered `ConfigurationClient` beans into a single bean.

You can either implement your own api:discovery.config.ConfigurationClient[] implementation or you can use one of the ones already built into Micronaut. The following sections cover those.
