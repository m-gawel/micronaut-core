https://zipkin.io[Zipkin] is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. It manages both the collection and lookup of this data.

== Running Zipkin

The quickest way to get up and started with Zipkin is with Docker:

.Running Zipkin with Docker
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
----

You can then open a browser tab to the location `http://localhost:9411` to view traces.

== Sending Traces to Zipkin

To send tracing spans to Zipkin the minimal configuration requires you add the following dependencies to `build.gradle` or `pom.xml`:

.Adding Zipkin Dependencies
[source,groovy]
----
runtime 'io.zipkin.brave:brave-instrumentation-http:4.19.0'
runtime 'io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter:2.5.0'
compile 'io.opentracing.brave:brave-opentracing:0.30.0'
----

Then you need to enable ZipKin tracing in your configuration (potentially only your production configuration):

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
tracing:
    zipkin:
        enabled: true
----

TIP: Or alternatively if you have the Micronaut CLI installed you can configure Zipkin when creating your service with: `mn create-app hello-world -features tracing-zipkin`

== Customizing the Zipkin Sender

By default an api:tracing.brave.sender.HttpClientSender[] that sends Spans asynchronously using Micronaut's native HTTP client to `http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans` will be configured.

It is unlikely that sending spans to localhost will be suitable for production deployment so you generally will want to configure the location of one or many Zipkin servers for production:

.Configuring Multiple Zipkin Servers
[source,yaml]
----
tracing:
    zipkin:
        enabled: true
        urls:
            - http://foo:9411
            - http://bar:9411
----

TIP: In production, setting `TRACING_ZIPKIN_URLS` environment variable with a comma separated list of URLs will also work.

Alternatively if you wish to use a different `zipkin2.reporter.Sender` implementation, you can simply define a bean that is of type `zipkin2.reporter.Sender` and it will be picked up.

== Zipkin Configuration

There are many configuration options available for the Brave client that sends Spans to Zipkin and they are generally exposed via the api:tracing.brave.BraveTracerConfiguration[] class. You can refer to the javadoc for all the available options.

Below is an example of customizing Zipkin configuration:

.Customizing Zipkin Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
tracing:
    zipkin:
        enabled: true
        traceId128Bit: true
        sampler:
            probability: 1
----

You can also optionally dependency inject common configuration classes into api:tracing.brave.BraveTracerConfiguration[] such as `brave.sampler.Sampler` just by defining them as beans. See the API for api:tracing.brave.BraveTracerConfiguration[] for available injection points.
