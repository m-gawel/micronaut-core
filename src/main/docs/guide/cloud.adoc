The majority of frameworks in use on the JVM were designed at a time when the Cloud and Microservices didn't exist and hence are filled with legacy, consume more memory due to being designed to run on traditional Java containers and include Cloud support as an add-on.

Micronaut is designed from the ground-up for building Microservices for the Cloud. In other words Micronaut truly embraces the industries current favorite buzzword: Cloud Native.

* Service Discovery
* Client Side Load Balancing
* Distributed Tracing
* Serverless Functions
